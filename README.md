# Disaster Images Classification

This project focuses on the classification of disaster images using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop an efficient model that can accurately identify different types of disasters based on visual information.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. It includes images of various disaster categories, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods, and cyclones.
- `nn_preprocessed_data/`: This directory contains preprocessed data, used for neural network tasks.
- `preprocessed_data/`: This directory contains preprocessed data, used for PCA tasks.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project. It includes scripts for model creation, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the required Python packages and their versions needed to run the project.

## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages by running the command :  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

2. Navigate to the `src/` directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the `main.py` script by executing the following command: python main.py
